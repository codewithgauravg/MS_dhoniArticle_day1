                <h2> The Cool Captain of India </h2>
                <p><b>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</b>, commonly known as MS Dhoni, was born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Bihar (now in
                    Jharkhand), India. He was born to Pan Singh and Devaki Devi, and he has an elder brother, Narendra
                    Singh Dhoni, and a sister, Jayanti Gupta. His family hails from the village of Lwali in the Lamgara
                    block of Almora District, Uttarakhand. Dhoni attended DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, where he initially
                    excelled in football as a goalkeeper before switching to cricket on the advice of his coach​
                    (Wikipedia)​​ (Times of Sports)​.

                    Domestic Cricket Career

                    Dhoni's journey in professional cricket began in 1998 when he was selected to play for the Central
                    Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team. His performance caught the attention of Deval Sahay, who helped him
                    get selected for the Bihar team. Dhoni made his debut for the senior Bihar Ranji Team in the
                    1999-2000 season. His consistent performances in domestic cricket eventually led to his selection in
                    the India A team in 2003​ (Times of Sports)​.

                    International Career

                    Dhoni made his One Day International (ODI) debut for India against Bangladesh on December 23, 2004.
                    He soon became known for his explosive batting and exceptional wicket-keeping skills. His Test debut
                    came a year later, on December 2, 2005, against Sri Lanka. Dhoni's leadership qualities were soon
                    recognized, and he was appointed captain of the Indian ODI team in 2007 and the Test team in 2008​
                    (Wikipedia)​​ (Times of Sports)​.

                    Captaincy and Achievements

                    Under Dhoni's captaincy, India achieved significant success. He led the Indian team to victory in
                    the inaugural ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, and the ICC Champions
                    Trophy in 2013. He is the only captain in history to have won all three major ICC trophies.
                    Additionally, India won the Asia Cup in 2010 and 2016 under his leadership​ (Wikipedia)​​
                    (Encyclopedia Britannica)​.

                    Dhoni is also celebrated for his calm demeanor and ability to remain composed under pressure,
                    earning him the nickname "Captain Cool". He played a pivotal role in developing a strong Indian team
                    that performed consistently well in all formats of the game​ (Encyclopedia Britannica)​.

                    Indian Premier League (IPL) Career

                    In the IPL, Dhoni has been the cornerstone of the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) since the league's
                    inception in 2008. Under his captaincy, CSK has won the IPL title five times (2010, 2011, 2018,
                    2021, and 2023) and has been runners-up on several occasions. Dhoni's leadership and performance in
                    the IPL have been exemplary, making him one of the most successful captains in the tournament's
                    history​ ​.
